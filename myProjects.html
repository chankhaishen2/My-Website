                <p>This project is my final year project done from April 2024 to June 2024. This project consists of a dummy e-commerce book shop website equipped with customer churn prediction feature powered by artificial neural network. The website has two types of user, namely administrator and customer. The website is built using javascript (Express.js). The customer churn prediction model is built using Tensor Flow. The training data originates from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fridrichmrtn/user-churn-dataset. The model is pre-trained and saved on the server and used when necessary. The churn prediction is made based on customer's activity on the website, such as number of viewing item, number of adding to cart and number of transactions. I would like to express my gratitute to my supervisor, Dr. Hing Ratana for his guidance.</p>

                <p>This project is my final year project done from August 2023 to November 2023. Although I managed to complete the project, but I failed this subject because I submitted late. This project consists of a dummy city complaint system website built based on MERN stack (MongoDB-Express.js-React.js-Node.js). The website has three types of users, namely complainant, complaint handler and administrator. The website allows administrator to view statistics of the complaints received by means of bar charts. The website confirms complainant's email address using One-Time Password (OTP) and sends notification via email when there is an update in the complaint case. The website loads areas and complaint category dynamically, allowing the administrator to specify the list of area and complaint category in the system. I would like to thank my supervisor, Mr. Light Lau Teng Lye for his guidance.</p>

                <p>Keywords: Express.js, MongoDB, Third Party API, REST API, Security, Password Hashing, PBKDF2, Password Rules, Password Strength Indicator</p>
                <p>This project is the coursework for two subjects, namely Web Application Programming Interface (API) Development (Task 1, April 2023 to July 2023) and Security (Task 2, August 2023 to November 2023). In Task 1, a website that uses a third-party API, SportsDB, as its source of data is developed. This website allows users to view the information, such as time, location and results, of any soccer event worldwide. Then, the user can save the event in bookmarks for future reference. In Task 2, the security aspects of the website are reviewed. Improvements are made in two aspects. Firstly, the password is hashed using Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) before stored in the database. Secondly, password rules, such as "must have numbers" or "must have special characters", are implemented and a simple password strength indicator is developed. I would like to thank my lecturers, Mr. Shahriman Mohd Said (Web API Development) and Mr. R.K. Krishnamoorthy (Security) for their guidance.</p>

                <h2>Customer Churn Prediction</h2>
                <p>Language: Python</p>
                <p>Software: Jupyter Notebook</p>
                <p>Keywords: Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Keras, Scikit Learn, Binary Classification, Regularization, One-Hot Encoding</p>
                <p>This project is the coursework for Machine Learning and Related Applications subject from August 2023 to November 2023. In this project, two machine learning methods, namely logistic regression and artificial neural network, are used to predict the customers of a telecommunication company as "churner" or "non-churner". The training dataset is originated from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/logisticregression-telecomcustomer-churmprediction. The data is pre-processed by using one-hot-encoding to transform categorical data into numerical data. Both machine learning models are fine tuned using L1 regularization, L2 regularization and elastic net regularization. All three regularization methods are compared based on accuracy. Both machine learning models (logistic regression and artificial neural network) are compared based on accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F-score and confusion matrix. Based on the observation, in predicting customer churn, logistic regression can achieve nearly same performance as artificial neural network. I would like to thank to my lecturer, Ms. Vasuky Mohanan for her guidance.</p>

                <p>This project is the coursework for Parallel and Distributed Programming subject from April 2023 to July 2023. There are six programming tasks in the question paper. Three of the six questions are related to parallel programming whereas three other questions are related to distributed programming. For parallel programming, part A is about printing "Hello World" from different threads; part B is about comparing static scheduling and dynamic scheduling in a parallel for loop based on time used; part C is about comparing the time used for parallel for loop with different number of threads and parallelizing different parts (outetmost loop and innermost loop) in matrix calculation. For distributed programming, part A is about printing "Hello" from different processes; part B is about sending different messages from different slave processes to the master process; part C is about the explaining the usage of message tags (the master process sends a message with tag "100" but the slave process waits for message with tag "101" so the program hangs, and the task is explains why the program hangs).

                <p>This project is the coursework for Data Science from April 2022 to July 2022. The coursework consists of eight questions. Question 1 is about assigning a variable to the dataset. Question 2 is about performing queries on the dataset. Question 3 is about visualizing certain columns of the dataset using histogram and replacing missing values based on skewness (if skewed, use median to replace missing values, else use mean). Question 4 is about computing the descriptive statistics (minimum value, mean, median and standard deviation) of certain columns. Question 5 is about filtering the dataset based on certain criteria. Question 6 is about visualizing the relationship of selected two columns (one is categorical value and the other is numerical value) using strip chart. Question 7 is about converting column with categorical value into numerical value. Question 8 is about computing the correlation between two numerical coulmns. I would like to thank my lecturer, Dr. Fakhitah Ridzuan for her guidance.</p>

This application is a simple dummy Android application that allows the user to work out on a few Geography quizes. This application is a front end application and lacks a database. All questions are hard-coded. In this project, intent is use to change page and send data between pages, whereas toast is used to display message to the user, whereas data binding is used to control the widgets (such as button and text view) on the user interface from the logic part.
