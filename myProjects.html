                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for Multimodal Information Retrieval subject from March 2025 to July 2025. This project involves a nearly full cycle artificial intelligence development cycle, which includes problem definition, dataset preparation, model training, model fine tuning, model comparison and model selection, but excludes model deployment. My lecturer splits the project into two parts, namely assignment and project. The assignment is the problem definition and dataset preparation, whereas the project is the remaining process of the artificial intelligence model development cycle until model selection, together with the report for all processes. In the assignment, I was grouped with Hneah Guey Ling, Loh Min Yi, Muhammed Jubarah, Liu Sixuan, Chen Ziyi, Jiang Runjiang, Zheng Chengjin and Goh Deng Vee. Our problem is about sunflower blooming stage classification into four classes (bud, partially bloom, fully bloom and wilt) based on image. In the assignment, my task was to collect 100 image of wilt sunflowers. I bought three fresh sunflowers, waited for the flowers to wilt, and take photo of the flowers. 51 of the 100 images were collected using this method, whereas the rest of the images were collected from Pinterest and Google Search. For the project, the group was halved, and I was grouped with Hneah Guey Ling, Loh Min Yi and Muhammed Jubarah. The team jointly trains, fine tune and compares a custom convolutional neural network model and transfer learning model using VGG-16, AlexNet and Inception V3 as the base model. My task was to conduct literature review and write the related work section in the report, and train and fine tune the transfer learning model with Inception V3 base model. The fine-tuning was done by experimenting different optimizers and different percentages of unfrozen convolutional layers. In the first experiment, all convolutional layers were frozen, and among Adam, Adagrad, RMS Prop and SGD, the model trained using Adam optimizer achieved the highest test and validation accuracy. In the second experiment, Adam optimizer is used, and among 0%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%, the overall performance of 10% unfrozen is the best (highest test validation and considerably high validation accuracy). In both experiments, the number of epochs is 10 and the learning rate is 0.0001. So, the best configuration for Inception V3 is 10% unfrozen and using Adam optimizer. I would like to thank my lecturer, Prof. Dr. Putra Sumari for his guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is my final year project done from April 2024 to June 2024. This project consists of a dummy e-commerce book shop website equipped with customer churn prediction feature powered by artificial neural network. The server is built using Express.js framework and MongoDB database. The customer churn prediction model is built using TensorFlow.js. The training data originates from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fridrichmrtn/user-churn-dataset. The model is pre-trained and saved on the server and used when necessary. The churn prediction model ingests 12 predictor variables for each customer. The variables are formed around customer's activity on the website, such as user session count, number of viewing item, number of adding to cart number of transactions and transaction amount. The customer churn prediction model is a simple artificial neural network with 1 input layer with 4 neurons using rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, 1 hidden layer with 4 neurons using ReLU activation function and 1 output layer with 1 neuron using sigmoid activation function. In this project, customer churn is defined as the customer will not visit to the website on the next month. As the result of the customer churn prediction model, the probability of churn of each customer is displayed to the administrator. The website has two types of user, namely administrator and customer. The administrator can view churn probability of each customer, add, edit, update stock and delete each item sold on the website and view all orders in the system. The customer can register themselves, view items sold (login is not required), add item to cart (login is required), place order for items which are in the cart (login is required) and view past orders (login is required). I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Hing Ratana for his guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for Machine Learning and Related Applications subject from August 2023 to November 2023. In this project, two machine learning methods, namely logistic regression and artificial neural network, are used to predict the customers of a telecommunication company as "churner" or "non-churner". The training dataset is originated from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/logisticregression-telecomcustomer-churmprediction. The data is pre-processed by using one-hot-encoding to transform categorical data into numerical data. Both machine learning models are fine tuned using L1 regularization, L2 regularization and elastic net regularization. All three regularization methods are compared based on accuracy. Both machine learning models (logistic regression and artificial neural network) are compared based on accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F-score and confusion matrix. Based on the observation, in predicting customer churn, logistic regression can achieve nearly same performance as artificial neural network.

                <p class="Description">This project is my final year project done from August 2023 to December 2023. Although I managed to complete the project, but I failed this subject because I submitted late. This project consists of a dummy city complaint system website built based on MERN stack (MongoDB-Express.js-React.js-Node.js). The website has three types of users, namely complainant, complaint handler and administrator. The website allows administrator to view statistics of the complaints received. The statistics is displayed in pie charts of complaint case count by area, by category and by status. The statistics is also displayed in stacked bar charts of complaint case count by area and by category (stacked by status). The statistics is also displayed in a summary table displaying the complaint case count in "received" status, "progressing" status, "solved" status and total case count for each category and area comnination. The website confirms complainant's email address using One-Time Password (OTP) and sends notification via email when there is an update in the complaint case. The website loads areas and complaint category dynamically, allowing the administrator to specify the list of area and complaint category in the system. The website allows complainant, complaint handler and administrator to add message to a complaint case. The message functionality is not in real time, but it provides necessary functionality for communication between complaint handler and complainant on the complaint case. The website also allows the administrator to assign complaint handler to a specific case, as well as allowing the complaint handler to choose to take charge of a complaint case which does not have complaint handler yet. The website allows the users to filter the complaint cases based on area, category and status, as well as allowing the users to sort the complaint cases based on area, category, status, title and date. The website also allows the users to search the complaint cases based on title, start date and end date. I would like to thank my supervisor, Mr. Light Lau Teng Lye for his guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is part of the coursework for Big Data Programming Project from August 2022 to November 2022. This project used data collected from Tesco grocery shop in London. The source of dataset is from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4769354.v2. This project has two parts, namely descriptive analysis and clustering. In the descriptive analysis part, the grocery purchase data is analysed based on its distribution (mean, median, first quartile, third quartile, minimum value and maximum value) and histograms and boxplots are drawn. Besides that, the grocery purchase data is used to draw a pie chart to illustrate the percentage of sales of each food and drinks category. In the clustering part, all customers are split into 4 clusters. While I was considering the number of clusters, different number of clusters are tried out and the sum of squared error within cluster and the Silhouette width are calculated. The graph of sum of squared error versus number of clusters and the graph of Silhouette width versus number of clusters are plotted. It is found that the suitable number of clusters is 4. The members of each cluster are analysed and the distinct behaviour of each cluster (in terms of fraction of buying certain type of food) is visualized using boxplots. The report is slightly edited on March 2025 to add more explanation on the formula of squared error and the calculation of Silhouette width I would like to thank my lecturer, Dr. Fakhitah Ridzuan for her guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for the first half of Advanced Algorithms and Complexity subject from March 2025 to May 2025. The first part of the task involves implementation of radix sort for sorting positive integers with a fixed length specified by the user. The task question does not mention radix sort in words but gives an illustration of steps of radix sort and asks that the logic of the code should follow the steps in the illustration. The second part involves implementation of radix sort for sorting words with variable length by modifying the code in the first part. The third part involves finding the time complexity of radix sort in Big-O by plotting a graph of number of primitive operations vs N. The code in the first and the second parts are modified by adding primitive operation counters. For number sorting, the experiment was conducted by setting the number of digits as the fixed variable, the number of numbers (N) as the manipulated variable and the number of primitive operations as the observed variable, whereas for word sorting, the experiment was conducted by setting the maximum number of characters as the fixed variable, the number of words (N) as the manipulated variable and the number of primitive operations as the observed variable. For both experiment, it was found that the number of primitive operations increases nearly linearly when N increases. So, it can be concluded that the Big-O time complexity of the algorithm (radix sort) is O(N). I would like to thank my lecturer, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Tan Tien Ping for his guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for the second half of the Advanced Algorithms and Complexity subject from May 2025 to July 2025. In this project, Bellman-Ford algorithm and Djikstra's algorithm are simulated using a graph provided in the task question and compared in terms of negative weight handling, negative cycle detection and time complexity. Both algorithms serve the same function, which is finding the shortest distance from one selected vertex to all other vertices in a graph. From the simulation, it is proven that Bellman-Ford algorithm is able to handle negative weight, whereas Djikstra's algorithm cannot. Moreover, Bellman-Ford algorithm can be modified to be able to detect and trace negative cycle, whereas Djikstra's algorithm cannot. However, by analysing the code, it is found that the time complexity of Djikstra's algorithm is O(n+m), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges, which is much lower than that of Bellman-Ford algorithm (O(nm)). I would like to thank my lecturer, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ahmad Sufril Azlan Mohamed for his guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for Advanced Algorithms subject from April 2022 to July 2022. There are four tasks in the question paper. Task 1 is related to storing and retrieving information with key in a hash table. The hash table handles key collision by chaining approach. Task 2 is related to comparing normal binary search tree and self-balancing binary search tree (AVL tree) based on time complexity and actual operation time. The experiment setting is inserting a sorted list of numbers and a random, not sorted list of numbers into a binary search tree and an AVL tree. This results in four different sets. On each of the four sets, a number which does not exist in the tree is searched. This forces the programme to search the full height of the tree. The operation time is recorded and compared accross the four sets. This is compared with the time complexity of search operation of binary search tree and AVL tree on sorted and random, not sorted dataset. Task 3 is finding routes between two nodes in a graph. The programme asks the user to input 2 nodes and the programme will determine whether the two nodes are connected. If the two nodes are neighbouring nodes, the programme will display the distance between the two nodes, else if the two nodes are connected via other nodes, the programme will display the route and distance between the two nodes, else if the two nodes are not connected, the programme will notify the user that these two nodes are not connected. Task 4 is about running four calculation operations concurrently. The sequence of the calculation operations are observed. Due to the property of concurrency, the sequence of the operations is different in different runs. I would like to thank my lecturer, Ms. Koo Lee Chun for her guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for two subjects, namely Web Application Programming Interface (API) Development (Task 1, April 2023 to July 2023) and Security (Task 2, August 2023 to November 2023). In Task 1, a website that uses a third-party API, SportsDB, as its source of data is developed. This website allows users to view the information, such as time, location and results, of any soccer event worldwide. Then, the user can save the event in bookmarks for future reference. The user can access his own bookmarks and view the list of bookmarked events, update the result of any event and remove any event from bookmark. On the other hand, the adminstrator can view all normal users and remove any normal user. In Task 2, the security aspects of the website are reviewed. The website already implements attribute-based (login is required to access user-specific bookmark) and role-based (login is required to access administrator functionality) access control. The website also already has password hashing by using Message Digest algorithm 5 (MD5). After analysing the existing website and researching the available security options, improvements are made in two aspects. Firstly, the password is hashed using Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) before stored in the database. The purpose of password hashing is to prevent the password from being revealed in case of the database is leaked. Before being hashed, the password is also appended with a random string called salt. Adding different salt to password of different user makes rainbow table attack (pre-compute the hashed passwords) less efficient. After salting, brute force attack is still efficient due to high computing power processor. So, the password hashing is made into a computationally heavy process by applying key stretching. So, PBKDF2 is used. Secondly, password rules, namely "must have numbers", "must have upper-case and lower-cse characters", "must have special characters", and "must have at least 10 characters" are implemented and a simple password strength indicator is developed. The first three rules are implemented to overcome dictionary attack (guessing the password from dictionary words) by introducing randomness in the password. The last rule (password length) is implemented to make brute force attack harder by making the password longer. When the password is longer, the number of all possible passwords is larger. As a reminder to the user, a password strength indicator based on the compliance of each rule and the password strength is developed on the registration page. The password strength is calculated based on password length and number of possible characters. I would like to thank my lecturers, Mr. Shahriman Mohd Said (Web API Development) and Mr. R.K. Krishnamoorthy (Security) for their guidance.</p>

                <p class="Description">This project is the coursework for Parallel and Distributed Programming subject from April 2023 to July 2023. There is one written technical report which covers the comparison between OpenMP and CUDA and the comparison between OpenMP and MPI. There are six programming tasks in the question paper. Three of the six questions are related to parallel programming whereas three other questions are related to distributed programming. For parallel programming, part A is about printing "Hello World" from different threads and specifying the number of threads through command line and source code; part B is about comparing static scheduling and dynamic scheduling in a parallel for loop executing vector addition based on the time used (the result is static scheduling is faster than dynamic scheduling because the workload of vector addition is almost equal in each iteration); part C is about comparing the time used for parallel for loop with different number of threads (and also serial) and parallelizing different parts (outetmost loop and innermost loop) in matrix multiplication (the result is outermost loop parallelization is faster than innermost loop parallelization because the number of iteration in innermost loop parallelization is thousand times more than that of outermost loop parallelization; another observation is when size of matrix is larger, parallelization is more efficient). For distributed programming, part A is about specializing the number of processes and printing "Hello" from different processes; the first part of part B is about each slave process sends a message to the master process and the master process prints the messages, whereas the second part is similar to the first part but this time each slave process sends a different message; the first part of part C is the master process sends a message to each slave process and each slave process prints the message, whereas the second part is about the explaining the usage of message tags (the master process sends a message with tag "100" but the slave process waits for message with tag "101" so the program hangs, and the task is explains why the program hangs). The report was slightly edited on March 2025 to include additional explanation on the observation of time used for matrix multiplication using different matrix sizes, number of threads and innermost loop parallelization and outermost loop parallelization.
